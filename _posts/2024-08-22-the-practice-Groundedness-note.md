The Anxiety of Dissatisfaction
Many successful people are so busy that they can't stop, and even when they do, they still feel uneasy, empty, or anxious, as if something is always missing. In their free time, they constantly check emails and social media, drowning their attention in noise. This stems from a male tendency to pursue personal heroism and endless success, leading to a narrow perspective that prevents true peace of mind.

**How to Overcome This?**
Cultivate a sense of groundedness that allows you to stay calm and unshakable regardless of the circumstances. Happiness equals reality minus expectations. Happiness doesn't come from simply pursuing more but from being fully engaged in the present and creating a meaningful life.

**Therapies for Anxiety**
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - Refer to the book Anxiety Toolkit.
Six Core Principles

**Acceptance**: Embrace your current state without worrying about what others think or what you believe you should become.

    **ACT Approach:**
    Accept: Recognize the gap between reality and perception, creating distance to objectively observe yourself and avoid getting caught up in it.
    Choose: Select the path your heart wants to follow.
    Take Action: Act even if you feel afraid or uncomfortable.
    Presence: Live in the present, not in the future or the past.

**Patience**: Stay patient.

**Vulnerability**: Embrace your vulnerabilities to develop genuine confidence.

**Connection**: Foster social connections.

**Exercise**: Maintain physical and mental health through exercise.

**Escaping the Thought Trap**

Meditation involves focusing on your breath and imagining yourself under a blue sky, observing your thoughts, feelings, and challenges as they pass by. Picture yourself watching from a distance. Due to the observer effect, the nature of what you observe will change, leading to clarity. Michele McDonald proposed the RAIN method:

1. Recognize: Identify the current situation.
2. Allow: Accept it.
3. Investigate: Explore your inner self with openness and curiosity.
4. Non-identification: Avoid being bound by past experiences, and observe the current situation from a broad perspective.

Another method is Self-Distancing:
1. Imagine a friend facing the same situation as you. What advice would you give them?
2. If you were yourself 10, 20, or 30 years in the future, what advice would you give?


By distancing yourself, you can better accept and address the situation rather than deny or resist it.

**Being Kind to Yourself**

The way you talk to yourself influences your reality. Constantly scolding yourself will reflect externally. Stop saying passive phrases like "I shouldn’t be in this situation," and instead say, "I wish I weren’t in this situation." Change phrases like "I should do this differently" to "I want to do this differently." This shift in tone reduces guilt, shame, and self-criticism.

**Facing Challenges**

Tell yourself, "This is the situation now, and I’m doing my best." Bring yourself back to the present and take effective action instead of resisting or ruminating. When faced with difficulty, remember to act first to break the deadlock, then choose your response.

**Identify Core Values**

These represent your best self or the principles you aspire to, such as health, authenticity, community, love, family, and creativity. These core values guide your actions. For example, when encountering a problem, ask yourself, "What would a creative person do?"

**Presence**

Presence means fully focusing on what’s in front of you, which brings power and stability. We often indulge in various attention-seeking habits and crave short-term stimulation. Buddhism teaches that you should consider yourself a gardener, nurturing growth through presence and attention, which ultimately shapes who you become.

**Building Connection**

Forming social connections brings a sense of belonging. The Self-Determination Theory (SDT) posits that fulfilling three human needs leads to success:

1. Autonomy: Control over your time and energy.
2. Competence: Progressing in your chosen pursuits.
3. Relatedness: Establishing connections and belonging.

Building friendships with like-minded individuals is crucial.

**Exercise**

Regular exercise is a keystone habit that positively influences other areas of life. Focusing on exercise is also a form of presence.
