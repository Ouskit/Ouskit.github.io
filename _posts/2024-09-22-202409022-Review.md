[How to Be Manifestly Happier - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/manifestation-positive-thinking-happiness/679695/)

Manifestation sometimes is effective, but sometimes it's not, even bad. But in happiness, it's effective.

>If you believe happiness is not under your control, you generally won’t do the work to get happier; if you believe happiness comes from your personal choices and behaviors, you will probably make an effort to improve your well-being.

- 4 ways to be happier:
  1. The goal is to get happier, not happy. : Even you can not be happy forever, but you can be happier.
  2. Envision progress. : Life is not always in happy state, but we can envision progress.
  3. Set the strategy.
  4. Get started. : The most important thing is to take action.

## A Profitable Day Trading Strategy For The U.S. Equity Market

[A Profitable Day Trading Strategy For The U.S. Equity Market by Carlo Zarattini, Andrea Barbon, Andrew Aziz :: SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4729284)

This paper explores a profitable day trading strategy for the U.S. equity market, focusing on the Opening Range Breakout (ORB) strategy, particularly the 5-minute ORB. By analyzing a vast dataset covering over 7,000 US stocks traded from 2016 to 2023, the study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy in producing consistent and uncorrelated returns. The research delves into the concept of Stocks in Play and provides detailed stock-specific statistics for the best and worst performers of the ORB strategy. The paper compares the performance of the 5-minute ORB strategy with a passive investment in the S&P 500, shedding light on day trading as a potential income source and its correlation with market returns.
