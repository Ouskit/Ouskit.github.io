# Personal Note
Recently I started looking for a job, and I was interviewed by many companies, and here is some thought after interview.

1. Lack of explaining detail of project
In the interview, I found that I lack of explaining detail of my project, actually, it maybe sound stupid, but it is actually needed to practice more and more when facing the infinite follow-up questions.

2. Lack of solving the coding problem
In the real coding interview, I found that I can't solve a problem that I've already written in the past. The real reason behind this problem is that I never solve by myself from zero.
